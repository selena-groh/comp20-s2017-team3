ACCOMPLISHED THIS WEEK:

        - Implemented game board with the graphics
        - Wrote JS functions to switch off between players (on one computer)
        - Added visual feedback for each player, and who has won more games
       
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHALLENGES AND ISSUES:

        - The algorithms to check if someone has won, if moves are valid, and other corner cases
        - Keeping the game board proportional and large enough when the browser window size changed
            - Still need to fix the board resizing when the browser window height is changed 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOALS FOR NEXT WEEK:
        
        1. Implement "multiplayer" so players can play from different computers
        2. Match players together
        3. Add game instructions for players

# Comments by Ming
* Good getting game board up
* "Still need to make decision on how a person finds an opponent." => doesn't have to be perfect.  Something hacked up will be perfect.  Ask if anyone else is doing this.
* Note: multiplayer isn't trivial...
