        Members: Selena Groh, Jillian Howarth, Ben Machlin,

        date   : April 7, 2017

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACCOMPLISHED THIS WEEK:

        - Discussed overall structure of project (client vs server side) and 
        how they interact and what to store on client vs server
        - Decided important data structures (arrays)
        - Implemented important game JS functions with correct logic
                - flipping the board
        - Implemented basic html/bootstrap/css for the game

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHALLENGES AND ISSUES:

        - Decision needs to be made on how a person finds an opponent, based on
        how easy it is for us to implement and what best suites our game.
        - Had some issues over how much/what information we actually want/need
        to store on the server, but overall resolved.
        - Decisions and research on what Javascript framework to use for the 
        game, but will keep exploring.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOALS FOR NEXT WEEK:
        
        1. Get visual of game board we can see (using pixiJS or JS framework)
        and possibly interact with
        2. Implement important functions for running the game
                - how to decide who won?
                - did they make a valid move?
                - who's turn is it?
