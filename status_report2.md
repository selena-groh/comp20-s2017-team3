ACCOMPLISHED THIS WEEK:

        - Implemented more important JS functions to game
            - flipping gravity, checking win
        - Began canva.js framework for game on board (in progress)
        - Integrated with Heroku 
        - Figured out what to store in mongoDB

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHALLENGES AND ISSUES:

        - Still need to make decision on how a person finds an opponent.
            - Current line of thought is to first implement "multiplayer" game
            on 1 computer. Once game is fully functional in that mode, and
            we have time, implement multiplayer across 2 computers.
        - First experimented with pixiJS to build game board, now switching
        to canva.js as better option.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOALS FOR NEXT WEEK:
        
        1. Get visual of game board we can see interact with (fully)
        2. Connect client to server
        3. Connect server to database
